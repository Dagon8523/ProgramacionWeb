            <h2>JAMIE THOMAS</h2>
            <img class="jamie" src="img/jamie.jpeg" alt="">
            <P>
                Jamie Thomas has defined himself by struggle.  
                When everyone was fresh, he was hesh… and dirty… and lived in his car. Be it the cool clique at Embarcadero, the fickle skateboard industry, the tenets of acceptable maneuvers or three King of the Road trips, Jamie has put a shoulder into it, charged forth teeth gnashed and ultimately conquered. Even when he was at the top of the mountain, lording over a building longer than a city block, when asked how he was doing he’d always say, “Oh, man. It’s tough. It’s really tough.” Which is just how Jamie Thomas likes it. In fact, let him get one more try at that gigantic 5-0. It’s easy to forget that skulls, acid drops and balls-to-the-wall shredditude were on the wane before Jamie’s Zero army. It’s hard to imagine that Chris Cole was stuck with the goof troop before the Chief gave him a shot. There’s so much of modern skateboarding that we take for granted that is either wholly or partially thanks to Jamie Thomas’s struggle; his vision of what makes skateboarding awesome. So when we hear rumors that Zero is downsizing or that Jamie is having knee problems we aren’t one bit concerned. In fact, we know that it’s probably just how he’d prefer things. The struggle is real, and Jamie Thomas fucking lives for it.

        <h2>CHAD MUSKA</h2>
        <img  class="muska"  src="img/chad.jpg" alt="">
        <p >
            Maple was Muska's first-ever skateboard deck company and he appeared in the 1994 video Rites of Passage. At the time, Muska was homeless and living on the beach, with no conception of what the future held for him.[3]
            After parting ways with Maple, Muska joined Toy Machine, which was prestigious among skateboarders at the time. Muska became a leading member of the Toy Machine team, facilitating Elissa Steamer's sponsorship, and was a team member alongside Ed Templeton, Mike Maldonado, Jamie Thomas, and Brian Anderson.[4] According to skateboarding journalist Adam Salo, in 2009: "In '95-'96, Toy Machine was one of the most respected and emulated teams in skateboarding."[5]
            Muska filmed for the Welcome to Hell video, a 1996 project primarily driven by Thomas, and he was expected to receive the highly regarded last part of the video. However, his part was only shown at the premiere and was omitted from the public video release due to an altercation with both Templeton and Thomas—a skull was placed over his face in the video case artwork.

        <h2>PETER SMOLIK</h2>

        <p>
            Peter Smolik straight changed the game in 1998. His seminal part in Shorty's Fulfill The Dream wasn't just technically the best thing to drop at the time, but also had an undeniable good vibe about it. Smolik oozed good times. Even his song, rapped by his mates The Federalz was about getting drunk and high - but instead of just doing that stuff, Peter was also producing some of the most stylish and sick shit on the streets of San Diego. If you didn't wear out your Fulfill The Dream VHS with constant watches then you were fucking blowing it. Truth be told, I am still still watching that part to this day. Now the don of Skate Mafia, Peter is still doing his thing and living life to the full. We spoke with him lately to ask him a few things about past, present and future Smolik
